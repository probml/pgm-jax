Gaussian Graphical Models in JAX.

We currently just support Gaussian loopy belief propagation. 
The code is based on [this PyTorch colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-nrE95X4UC9FBLR0-cTnsIP_XhA_PZKW?usp=sharing)
by Joseph Ortiz, which is explained at https://gaussianbp.github.io/.
This allows for nonlinear factors by iteratively linearizing the factors.
Thus the MAP estimate corresponds to solving a nonlinear least squares problem.

In the future we may add exact Gaussian inference based on junction trees, and Gaussian variational inference.
